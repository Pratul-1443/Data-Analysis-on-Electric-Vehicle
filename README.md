# Data-Analysis-on-Electric-Vehicle

Conclusions from the Analysis:
🔋 Electric Range Distribution: The analysis of electric ranges shows most vehicles fall within a typical range, with a few outliers having very high or low ranges. This may indicate a standardization of battery capacities in the market.

🏙️ Legislative Districts: The spread of vehicles across various legislative districts suggests areas where infrastructure for electric vehicles (like charging stations) might need to be improved or is already well-established.

🌍 Geographic Distribution: The concentration of electric vehicles in certain locations suggests that adoption rates are higher in some cities/states, potentially influenced by government incentives 💰 or the availability of charging infrastructure ⚡.

Overall Conclusion:
This analysis highlights key trends in the adoption of electric vehicles, both geographically 🌍 and in terms of performance 🔋 (electric range). The visualizations, particularly the bar chart race 🏁, provide a dynamic view of how manufacturers are competing over time, while the histograms 📊 give a deeper understanding of the data distribution.

📈 This information can be used by policymakers and manufacturers to target areas for improvement, such as increasing the electric vehicle range or expanding infrastructure in underserved locations ⚡🚗.
